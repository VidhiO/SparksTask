            There are children in India who were born to parents but are now left alone to fend for themselves. These children are either thrown in a dumpster or left to survive in the orphanage, with no idea where to earn their bread and butter. It would be natural
            to think for such children and take affirmative action in some form. Looking for a nearby orphanage to donate meals, clothes, money, etc. could be the very first step. Just remember, every bit helps. While there are several means to support
            them, one of the most trusted ways is to get associated with an NGO. Your donation for orphans through an NGO will ensure that the children are not shunted out to brave the streets without any help or support.
